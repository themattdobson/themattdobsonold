# Hello there, I’m Matt Dobson, a product designer living in Louisville, KY.
I'm fortunate to be part of the team at Humana’s [Digital Experience Center](http://www.humana.io/) a technology incubator working to transform Humana into a human-centered, tech-driven company. In my free time I help organize the Louisville’s [IxDA chapter](https://www.meetup.com/ixdalouisville/) and in 2016 was part of the team that organized the [Midwest UX Conference](http://2016.midwestuxconference.com/) in Louisville.

Previously I was an art director at [Power](https://www.poweragency.com/), published a [monthly newspaper](http://www.thelouisvillepaper.com/), and was a co-producer of a late-night variety show at a [Tony Award winning theatre](https://actorstheatre.org/).

You can see my resume here or email me at [matt@mattdobson.com](mailto:matt@mattdobson.com)
